# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for completing the roulette game simulation. The game currently has basic structure but needs bug fixes, missing functionality implementation, and a proper user interface to create a fully playable roulette experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to interact with the game through a command-line interface, so that I can play roulette without needing to modify code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message and game instructions
2. WHEN a player starts THEN the system SHALL prompt for their initial deposit amount
3. WHEN a player enters a valid deposit amount THEN the system SHALL create a player with that balance
4. WHEN a player enters an invalid deposit amount THEN the system SHALL display an error and prompt again

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to place bets on different colors, so that I can participate in the roulette game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN it's betting time THEN the system SHALL display the player's current balance
2. WHEN the system prompts for a bet THEN the player SHALL be able to choose bet amount and color (Red, Black, or Green)
3. WHEN a player enters a valid bet amount and color THEN the system SHALL deduct the amount from their balance and place the bet
4. WHEN a player enters a bet amount greater than their balance THEN the system SHALL display an error and prompt again
5. WHEN a player enters an invalid color choice THEN the system SHALL display an error and prompt again

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see the wheel spin and results, so that I know if I won or lost my bets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all bets are placed THEN the system SHALL spin the wheel and display the winning number and color
2. WHEN the wheel stops THEN the system SHALL calculate and display payout results for each bet
3. WHEN a bet wins THEN the system SHALL add the winnings to the player's balance
4. WHEN a bet loses THEN the system SHALL not modify the player's balance (amount already deducted)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to continue playing multiple rounds, so that I can enjoy extended gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a round ends THEN the system SHALL ask if the player wants to play another round
2. WHEN a player chooses to continue AND has sufficient balance THEN the system SHALL start a new betting round
3. WHEN a player chooses to quit OR has zero balance THEN the system SHALL display final balance and exit gracefully
4. WHEN a player has insufficient balance for minimum bet THEN the system SHALL offer to make a deposit or quit

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the game code to be bug-free and properly structured, so that it runs correctly and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the wheel spins THEN the system SHALL correctly return both position and color information
2. WHEN bets are processed THEN the system SHALL use the correct payout odds (2:1 for Red/Black, 35:1 for Green)
3. WHEN the table processes payouts THEN the system SHALL pass the winning color to each bet's payout method
4. WHEN methods are called THEN the system SHALL not have any syntax errors or typos in method names
5. WHEN the game runs THEN the system SHALL handle all edge cases gracefully without crashing
